Ingres-Utility-IINamu version 0.01

This module provides an API to the iinamu utility for Ingres RDBMS,
which provides local interaction and control of IIGCN server,
in charge of registering all Ingres services.

Through this interface, it is possible to obtain a list of all
registered services, for later processing (eg. iimonitor), and
also stopping the IIGCN server (extreme caution!).

To use this module, the current user should be the Ingres
installation owner, usually "ingres", to have rights to
use all features.

Environment variables (II_SYSTEM et ali) should be set also.
